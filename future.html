		                	It is hard for me to say at this point what I would like to do after Galvanize. I am a big believer in giving back and I would love to help a newbie learn the ropes and get them excited learning Web Dev. I also want to finish up school with a computer science degree. I would like to work for a startup I am open to almost anything one of my strong qualities is flexibility. I like the idea of working for a company like soundcloud or something in web design. I will have a much better idea of where I want to go after completing this course. Its going to be challenging but I am super excited to learn with you all over the next six months!!
